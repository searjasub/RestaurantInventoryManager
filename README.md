Restaurant Inventory Manager


VISION

A program that that owners of restaurants can use to more easily track where the money goes in their business.

MAJOR FEATURES

Some major features include an administrative scene where the “administrator” can view inventory, employee data, adding/deleting an employee. The administrator could also view and track items that have been ordered. A POS scene where a user can place orders, the orders then actively affect the inventory and the inventory changes as every order is well ordered. Also, the administrator would be able to view all the assets of the restaurant, gathering a “net worth” of the company. Along with that, the administrator will get suggestive menu updates, sort of like “oh this menu item hasn’t been selling well maybe you would like to revisit leaving it in the menu” or something along those lines. Lastly, we will include reports for the owner with relevant data about that month’s performance.

DECISION MAKING PLAN

The decisions will be managed through a voting system. Since there are 5 of us, there won’t be a tide for any decisions. Outside of class, we will communicate through our team’s Discord channel. Any new ideas need to be approved for the majority of the group to implement them. Full commitment from each member after the decision has been cast.
  
REQUIRED TECHNOLOGIES

The application will be developed using Java 8. The project will be in Maven since we are using Eclipse and IntelliJ as IDEs for the project. The graphics will be done through JavaFx. We will use SceneBuilder to help us with the GUI portion, as well as, raw XML. No external APIs will be used with this project.

UNDERSTOOD TECHNOLOGIES

  •	JavaFx (SceneBuilder & FXML) – for GUI
  •	Java – back-end development for the application
  •	UML
  •	MongoDB – Database for persistence of the data

NEW TECHNOLOGIES/CONCEPTS

Currently we do not use new technologies or concept. We discussed trying to make this app an android mobile app, which will take a lot of time to master it so the final product can be presentable.
